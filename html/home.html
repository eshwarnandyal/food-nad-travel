          <h1>BIRYANI</h1>
          <p>
            Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. <br>
            Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine.<br>
            Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the <br>
            first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition.<br>
            In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South <br>
            Asian culture,[4][5] resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani <br>
            Hyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating <br>
            from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly mutton). Originating in the kitchens <br>
            of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani<br>
            is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and it is so famous that the dish is considered <br>
            synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.

          <h1 id="pz">Pizza</h1>
          <p id="p">Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian <br>
              origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes,<br>
               cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms,<br>
                onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally<br> 
            in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.<br>

                          In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.<br>
             In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.<br>
            The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of<br>
             Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4]</p>

          <h1>Rocklette</h1>
          <p>
            Dishes of melted cheese were mentioned in medieval texts from Swiss convents as early as 1291. <br>
             [6] Melted cheese was originally consumed by peasants in the mountainous Alpine regions of the <br>
             cantons of Valais and Fribourg (Switzerland), and Savoie and Haute-Savoie (France). It was then <br>
             known in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as Bratchäs or Bratkäse, "roasted cheese". <br>
             Traditionally, cow herders carried cheese with them when they were moving cows to or from pastures<br>
              up in the mountains. In the evening, the cheese would be placed next to a campfire for softening,<br>
               then scraped onto bread. Melting raclette-type cheese in front of a fire is attested in Valais since<br>
                1574. Since 1875, the French term raclette is commonly used for this dish. At the 1909 Cantonal<br>
                 Exhibition of Sion, raclette was promoted as a national dish of Valais. Raclette eventually gained <br>
                 national (and international) popularity from the 1964 National Exhibition.[7

        <h1 id="pz">Oozie</h1>
        <p id="p">In Iraqi cuisine, it is usually prepared by stuffing a whole lamb with rice, vegetables, spices and nuts<br>
           and slow-cooking it over a closed or submerged oven.[2] In some places in the Middle East it is buried in a pit<br>
            containing burning coal or charcoal to get the smoky flavor.

          There are many variations to this technique such as in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, where it is called madfoon,<br>
           cooked by being wrapped in aluminium foil and kept on an open heat source. In Oman and UAE it is called<br>
            shuwaa and is traditionally eaten on festive occasions, prepared by wrapping the marinated meat in date <br>
            palm leaves and placing the wrapped meat in a submerged oven.</p>
